# ch10testScores

Create a project that creates an array that holds a series of 6 test scores which are input by the user. Display the values in the array and calculate the average test score and letter grade. Make the program modular by using functions that handle each task -- getting the scores, displaying the array, calculating the average and letter grade. Use pointer notation instead of subscripts throughout the program. Refer to Program 10-6.

Ch 10 Test Scores letter grades

Here is an example:

![p](https://github.com/bell-kevin/ch10testScores/blob/main/grades2.PNG)

Create a table of test cases BEFORE you write and run your project to calculate the correct results for different sets of test scores. Create 3 test cases. Run your code, enter the data from each test case, and compare your results to those test cases. Take screenshots of all 3 results.

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots, the table of test cases  AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
